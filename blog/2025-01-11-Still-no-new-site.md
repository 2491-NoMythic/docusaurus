Chris and I ended up working on other things than porting this over, so there's going to be a few more updates here. 
* PID Looping (Me, Rowan, Griffin, Davey): All of us worked on adding PID loops and constants to the various subsystems. 
* Swerve cleanup (Me, Rowan): The swerve drive code has now been altered for improved readability. 
* Reef Lineup (Xiaohan, Nigel, Serena): These three continued working on the code to automatically align the robot with the reef. 
* Auto Configuration (Serena): Serena did some experimentation in pathplanner.
* Reef Sensor Work (Griffin): Griffin finished the close-in reef sensor and alignment code. 

I really, really hope we can switch sites next week.
