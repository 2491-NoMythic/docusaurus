This post is so named because I actually was to be in the gym while the robot was being tested. And what a test it was.
* Voltage & Current Limiters (Me, Griffin): It was noticed that the robot was having brownout issues due to the sheer number of motors and subsystems, so we were assigned to do something about it. This meant making bits of code that would display the voltages and currents, and then making limiters that would stop the various motors from drawing too much power. It should also be noted that I called this around week 2 when I did the math and realised that the robot would have around 16 motors. 
* General Testing (Rowan, Serena, Xiaohan, Zach): These four were using the robot for most of practice. They managed to make a path that would let us consistently score in the amp and finished it right after dinner. Then they came down to the practice field to make a number of tests. The main one was odometry, which took a large chunk of time. 

Also Griffin and I got bored so we went outside and played catch with one of the spare notes for about 10-15 minutes.
