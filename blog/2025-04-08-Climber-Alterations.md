So, it's been a while since the last post. This is mostly my fault, I forgot and no-one else on the team writes these at this point. Anyway, we won 10K with Binary Bolts and Rodeo Robotics, and have spent the past few weeks doing what we can in preperation for Worlds. 
* Rotator removal (Me): As the robot no longer has a funnel rotator, I had to reassign the buttons and remove the code. 
* Algae Improvements (Rowan, Xiaohan, Serena): We now have commands that can collect algae from L3 and L4 without knocking off coral. 
* L1 Scoring (Rowan, Xiaohan, Serena, Zach): This works now.
* Robot Summary (Davey): A list of our capabilities and automatic functions was compiled and sent to Ops.
* Warmup Command (Nigel): This command turns on the lights and prevents some jitters. 
* Profiling Research (Griffin): This happened. We are well on our way to correcting the loop overruns that plauged us at 10K. 

Also, Mowi worked on the robot reveal video.
