Today was a fairly normal practice. Yours Truly™ taught the New Trio how to make autos. They all got basic driving autos done by the end of the night. Captain 23 put swerve stuff on Shuffleboard. I helped test a claw that won't be used, went to a meeting to decide the intake, and was going to work on intake skeletons but deleted the example stuff first and had to spend the rest of practice fixing things.

Terminate log.
