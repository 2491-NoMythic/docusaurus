Welcome to the new season, we will be here a while. For a description of the game or kickoff, please look elsewhere, this is just a documentation of programming affairs. In addition, there is no blog post for the swerve intensive that happened over winter break because I forgot to write one. So, things we did today:
* Shooter Subsystem (Us): We wrote a shooter subsystem, with the attached commands, constants, and triggers.
* Moira Work (Xiaohan, Serena): Moira broke in the process of the swerve instensive, so it had to be fixed. The issue was a simple matter of installing the new RoboRio firmware. In addition, the robot was reconfigured to work with two limelights. Note: Moira is currently the test robot for all of our stuff until the new one is built, as it is basically just a swerve chassis with a limelight.
* Apriltag printing (Davey): New year, new game, new Apriltags. Davey printed them out.
* Intake work (Serena, Zack): They began construction on the intake subsystem. They did not get very far, as both were called away. 

That's all for tonight.
