Captain 23 came back for the day!

* PID and Offset Training (Me, Zach, Serena, Rowan, Captain 23): Captain 23 trained us all in how PID and offsets work with swerve. PID stands for Porportional, Interval, Derivative, which is a lot of fancy math none of us understand the 'why' of, just the 'how'. Offsets are how we get all of the swerve motors moving in the same direction.
* Command-Based Motors (Griffin, Davy): Griffin taught Davy how to make command-based robot code and spin a motor. 
* Minne Trials Update (Xiaohan): More work was done on the Minne trials drive code.

The name comes from the fact that everyone in an orchestra tunes around the oboe, because oboes are a pain to tune, or something. I wouldn't know, I played drums.
