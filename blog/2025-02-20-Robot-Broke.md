So we broke the algae endeffector during testing. Oh well.
* Button Board Work (Me, Griffin, Zach): The button board CADing was continued by Zach and Griffin. I added the extra twelve Liam-requested positional buttons to the code. 
* Elastic Work (Davey, Nigel): These two started working on saving Elastic layouts in Github, instead of needing to manually configure it on every device. This was hampered by a network table error that was caused by the CAN network not being connected. 
* Algae Endeffector Testing (Act of Liam, Rowan, Xiaohan): The algae endeffector was tested, both before and after being repaired. The code worked, but the endeffector failed to collect algae from the reef mockup.

Also, Mowi and Serena worked on the robot reveal video.
