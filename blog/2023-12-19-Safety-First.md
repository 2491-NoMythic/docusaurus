Today was a safety training day for the team. Teen safety, not shop safety. But work never stops, so here is the list of things done in programming today:
* New Student Update (Zack, Griffin, Davey, Serena(?)): The new students have code on the Minne Trials robot that functions. They spent a good chunk of the second half driving around said robot. Serena even has a functional auto.
* 2024 Updating (Me, Rowan): Some of the 2024 WPI and FRC stuff has working betas, so we downloaded them to some of the computers. Currently it is on 2, 4, 5, and 8.
* Moirai Work (Xiaohan): Moirai has functional LEDs and a limelight.
* Swerve Work (Rowan and Xiaohan): Rowan tried to get the offsets working on one of the swerve chassis, while Xaiohan worked on code.

This is more items than usual.
