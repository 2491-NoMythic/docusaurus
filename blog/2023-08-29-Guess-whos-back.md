We are back! Things that happened today:
* Safe Mode (Me): Our robot is going to the fair, so we needed to make it safe. The drive and arm speeds were lowered and intake was switched off.
* XPT night planning (Quinn): The Experience the Team nights were planned. We will have three things: Python coding, circuit board anatomy, and robot driving. 
* Inventory (Rowan): Rowan went through our parts stockpile to figure out what we needed.

I am going to be doing less posting from now on, because I need to do important work.
