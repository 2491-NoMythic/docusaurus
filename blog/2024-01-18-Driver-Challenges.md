Today the intital driver tryouts occured for the season. They were using Moirai, which has been stripped down to just a drivetrain. I wasn't really involved outside of running batteries down to the gym. Anyway, other things that happened:
* Intake finishing (Griffin and I): We finished the intake, adding all of the various methods to RobotContainer. In addition, Evan showed us how to make the triggers actually work properly and not throw unsupported exception errors as soon as we turned it on.
* Limelight work (Xiaohan, Zach, Davey, Griffin, Rowan): We have twin limelight capability now. The plan is to either use one for Apriltag tracking (so the robot knows where it is) and one for a neural net (so it can automatically pick up game peices), or both for Apriltags. 
* Autoaim testing (Rowan, Serena): The autoaim program was going to be tested, but then a drive motor seized up. We are 99% sure it's a motor problem, not a code problem.
* Angle math (Rowan): Rowan did the math to find the shooter's required angle based on distance.

I need sleep.
