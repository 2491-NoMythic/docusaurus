Programming is running out of things to do. There are nine of us, and it's the same three (Rowan, Xiaohan, and Zach) at the practice field every day. Most of what remains is easily accomplished or related to the robot, which the rest of us don't have. But there are still things to be accounted for.
* Code Cleanup (Me, Griffin): The unused imports have been removed and unclear code has been commented.
* Button Board 2 Work (Me, Davey, Griffin, Zach): There were many buttons to solder today. Everyone took a turn at soldering. 
* WPILib updates (Nigel): This happened. 
* Practice Field Work (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): They worked on 4-coral and 3-coral autos. The 3-coral worked about 90% of the time, and the 4-coral autos exceeded the 15-second timespan. 
* Programming Cart Cleanup (Serena, Davey, Nigel): This happened. 

Also, a number of people helped with bumper construction.
