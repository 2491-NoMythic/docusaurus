It's week 7 of TEST, and the deadline is closing in. 
Ben and I spent practice working on a subsytem for Griffins called Thomas, and there is not a good way to explain what that is. 
We also spent a lot of time struggling with imports. We can't wait to start testing on the Robot. BUILD.

Quinn finished the Torbs code. He also spent time creating a slideshow to map out the PS4 buttons.

CornerGremlin spent her time organizing the cart. Everything is super neat now. We even found the TV remote in the process!

Captain 23 worked on swerve stuff, and Liam did a little bit of everything. 

Mowi learned how to program a controller today. Yay!

Apologies for the lack of content. Closing meeting is soon. 
Overall rating of the day: 7.5/10.

A desperate Dream, and a fire inside,
