Today, Programming was almost entirely occupied with PID tuning. 

PID tuning is a very complicated subject, but it boils down to giving the robot numbers so that it knows what distances are and how to travel distances. If you want to know more about the subject, follow the link (here)[https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-pid.html]. The first hour of practice was devoted to learning how PID tuning worked, and then Royce, Rowan, and Omariahn kept PID tuning the robot for the rest of practice. By the end, they had managed to get the robot to spin and push a cone. This means we basically have a working auto three weeks before Duluth, which is probably a record for the team. I helped a little, but did not do much outside of asking obvious questions and reminding Royce to flip the tables so they worked as barricades. 

Other things that happened today included Ben working on a new page for this website and Evelyn doing a bunch of wiring. 

Week 5 already? Jeez.
