It is almost the start of the next training season, and so we are meeting again. Things done today:

* Slow Mode (Me): I made a 'slow mode' for the robot that slows down everything and rebinds all of the non-driving controls to the operator controller. This is designed for the state fair. A second version with slightly upped speeds and re-rebound controls will likely be made for the Experience the Team nights. 
* Button board disassembly (Davey): Davey disassembled an old button board. 
* Circuit Playground Setup (Serena, Griffin, Zack): Some prep work was done to get ready for the Experience the Team nights. This was slightly hampered by the fact that half of our good computers are missing and the worse computers don't work with the circuit playgrounds. 

Signing Off.
