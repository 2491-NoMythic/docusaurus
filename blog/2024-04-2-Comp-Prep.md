Not much to do today. The next three days will be 10k for us, so we prepared for that.
* Drive Drive Drive(Zack-and a Xiaohan): Our members of drive team worked on practicing cycles, and getting ready for 10k
* Pack, man(Augie, Davey, Griffin, Serena): Whenever anyone didn't have anything to do, they would do some packing. This 
  consisted of labeling, and moving.
* Amp-shot Test(Augie, Rowan, Xiaohan): They tested amp shot to make it more reliable, because that is one of our goals for 10k
  Unfortunately, the amp shot isn't reving down enough, so it has been overshooting
* Mathmatics is their passion(Rowan, Serena, Xiaohan, Zack): They worked on improving the math of the shooter, and have been having trouble with the set-points being off.
