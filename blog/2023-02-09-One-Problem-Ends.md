Today was a very happy day for programming, as a lot of code got merged from the branches on to main. This included code for the endeffector, arm, and most importantly the Swerve Drive. It is finally done! 

On the other hand, the more things change the more they stay the same. We worked on limelight code. Captain 23 started work on telling the robot to move to given coordiantes. I was supposed to work on turning limelight data into coordinates, but I just added a network table and tried to parse the syntax from the website.

Meanwhile, Yours Trulyâ„¢, Rowan, and Mowi worked on PID tuning the old TEST robot. That went well. CornerGremlin was working on swerve wiring. 

Unraveling.
