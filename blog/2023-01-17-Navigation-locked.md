Working 4:30 to 8:30, something something something meaning~

Tonight the highlight was a planning meeting wih build where we decided what arm design to use. Roughly. We know it's going to have a few joints run by chains, which is progress! Also, the new trio finally got to testing Robot code! Rowan and CornerGremlin were sucessful before dinner - CornerGremlin right before she had to leave. Mowi tested his code right after dinner. Other notable things that happened:
* Quinn learned swerve stuff from Captain 23.
* I worked on skeleton code for the arm. There were some bugs, but nothing restarting VScode couldn't fix.
* Captain 23 and I worked on troubleshooting the swerve modules and dealing with firmware updates.

That's all, folks!
