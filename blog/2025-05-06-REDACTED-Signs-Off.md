Nothing really happened today. It's the end of the season, and we did most everything already. This was the last programming practice with this team: Serena, Omariahn, and I are graduating, and Davey's leaving for Ops. Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach, Griffin, and Nigel, we leave programming in your capable hands. The blog will likely die now, as none of you have expressed an interest in keeping it going. With all of that said, things done in programming today:

* Code Merging (Everyone): This is the main thing of import that happened today, as we did a big code review. 
* Processor Shot (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): This now works 9/10 times thanks to automatically angling the robot at the processor. 

Signing Off.
