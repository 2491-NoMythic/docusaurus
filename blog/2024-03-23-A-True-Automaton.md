We spent the first chunk of practice working on autoaim and auto pickup. As the robot can do almost everything automatically now, I thought the title was appropriate.
* Autoaim work (Rowan, Me, Serena): The morning was speant testing various equations for the autoaim. This involved both Desmos and a spreadsheet. 
* Autopickup work (Zach, Rowan): The afternoon before most of the group left for the practice field was spent trying to get the autopickup to be more accurate, and only go for the closest note.
* Field Disassembly (Me, Davey, Griffin): The field at Great River finally needed to be put back in the closet. 
* Photonvision research (Davey, Griffin): People looked into cameras that won't break our budget.
