The button board prototype is built, and the buttons make a wonderful clicking noise.
* Button Board Work (Me, Omariahn): The prototype board is built, the board-side code works with the prototype, and the computer-side code is completed.
* Sine Wave Funnel (Davey, Act of Liam, Rowan, Xiaohan): This worked most of the time. It takes half a second to intake a coral. However, it still bounces when the coral is dropped at an angle.
* Lights (Griffin): Minor touchups on logic. Started CANdle integration. 
* Funnel Rotator Trigger (Zach): This works now. 
* Path Improvements (Zach): The paths for lining up with the reef should be more reliable.
* Advantage Scope Alterations (Act of Liam): Our drivetrain exists there now.
