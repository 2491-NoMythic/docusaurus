Most of the Avalon contingent (read: everyone but Davy and I) was at the Halloween Dance, Build canceled practice, and conferences were happening so the rest of us were crammed into the build room. There weren't that many of us total.
* Minne Trials Code Testing (Xiaohan): Xiaohan spent practice trying to get the drivetrain for Minne Trials functioning. 
* Computer Resets (Me, Emilio "[M]", Evan "[M]"): We reset the crashed computers and set up the two new computers. They all have VSCode and Git installed, along with the field tools. 
* Command Based Programing (Davy, Griffin): Griffin and Davy (mostly Griffin, as Davy had to leave early) learned how command based programming work. 

Adios.
