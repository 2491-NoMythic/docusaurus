Sorry about the lack of posts, I've been working on other stuff. Anyway, things done today:
* Button Board Completion (Me, Mowi, Xiaohan, Davey): The button board wiring was completed today. We got the case last week, and put all the buttons into the physical board on Saturday. We tested it today, and it worked. Apparently we're staying late tonight to add the a button everyone forgot about. 
* ALgae Endeffector Work (Zach): The motor was changed to a Talon FXS.  
* Climber Fixes (Serena, Nigel): The climber switched to using a servo for the ratchet and no longer overspools, so the code had to be altered. 
* WPICal (Davey): Still not working. Apparently it is very bad at working on the Reefscape field.

And in the last few minutes of practice we erased the ENTIRE BOARD CODE!
