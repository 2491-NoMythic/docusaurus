We had an open house today during the last chunk of practice. This required an earlier dinner than usual. 50% of programming was in the gym getting the robot working. Nothing much else of import happened. 
* Updating (All present): We made sure that all of the computers were updated with the latest WPIlib, Phoenix Tuner X, and Pathplanner versions. 
* Logging (Zach, Serena): More work was done on data logging, specifically the drivetrain current.
* Fighting with Git (Me, Evan [M]): I fought with Git because of commit issues with the pathplanner stuff.

Too tired to be funny.
