Lots of things happened today!

* Arm Testing (Royce): The arm works now! 
* Tyche Motor Alignment (Me, Omariahn, Evelyn, Ben, Royce): Tyche's drivetrain needed to be aligned. I started testing it, then when it turned out to be beyond my area of expertise it was turned over to Evelyn and Omariahn. This took up most of the day, becuase the motors simply would not align properly. Either one was 90 degrees away from the others, or the front and back were swapped, or one of half a million other things. Royce and Ben helped out later, and eventually Royce came through with a solution: it was needed to get the offset of the motors earlier than we had been. I didn't actually help a lot. 
* Backup Swerve Offsets (Omariahn and Evelyn): A spare swerve module needed to have its offsets found. It required Frankenstiening together a few other things with the module but was doable.

One more (full-team) practice, and then Duluth.
