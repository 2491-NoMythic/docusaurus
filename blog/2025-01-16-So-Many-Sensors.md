Today was a day for coding sensors. Just, so many sensors.

* Triple Limelight Testing (Rowan, Zach): These two did more work on the triple limelight code.
* Elevator work (Me): I added distance sensor code without any distance sensors to the elevator.
* Named Commands (Serena, Davey): Named commands were made.
* Distance Sensor Slowdown (Act of Liam, Griffin): The distance sensors will now make the robot slow down before it hits things.
It only took eight collisions with the wall.

I think some other stuff happened, but I am finishing this late.
