Many things happened today. So many things that we are extending practice. 

* Climber Inmprovements (Me): The climber now requires two-factor authentication and can be reset. There are plans to create a timer for disabling two-factor authentication in the extra practice. 
* Button Board Work (Me, Zach, Griffin, Omariahn): There was much work to be done on the actual board. Zach and Omariahn planned the layout, Griffin started the CAD work, and I worked on code alterations and coordination between the groups. And then Liam decided to drop an extra twelve buttons on us. 
* Lights work (Rowan, Nigel, Griffin, Serena): The CANdles are connected and the lights glow.
* Duplicate PID Constants (Griffin): There are now duplicate practice and competition robot constants.
* Button Bindings (Zach, Xiaohan, Me): The button bindings on our non-custom controllers were finalized. There is actually going to be variation in what is on each. 
* Pathplanner Adjusting (Zach): Everything has been moved slightly to the right. 

Also, Davey went to the bumper workshop.
