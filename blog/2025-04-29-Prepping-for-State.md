Apoloies about the lack of updates for the past several weeks. It was mostly auto work, Worlds, and recovering from Worlds. As for how we did there? No awards, ranked 25th, ended up as 3rd pick of Hopper Alliance 2. They got to the division finals and we lost because they didn't submit the thing to let us swap with a broken robot in time. There were also more captain selections. The final roster is: Opal for all-team, Leo for design, Orion for production, Lio and May for operations, and Rowan and Zach for programming. Anyway, actual programming things done today:
* Trigger Fixes (Me): Drive team was running into issues where the robot wasn't reading the buttonboard on startup, so I fixed that. The solution was to stop making everything triggers. 
* Algae Pickup Improvements (Rowan, Serena, Nigel): We can now pick up algae better, although this code hasn't been tested. 
* Processor Improvements (Xiaohan): This wasn't working great, so Xiaohan wrote a new and improved processor command. 
* Algae Autos (Griffin, Zach): The various autos were made substantially faster. There were also some new autos made to steal algae from the opposing alliance. 
* Simulation Research (Nigel): This happened.
* ClosestReefSide Fixes (Serena, Nigel): Currently the ClosestReefSide based on alliance is read from the driver station rather than the field X-coordinates. A fix to this was started. 

As we have ceased Thursday and Saturday practices, there will not be more posts this week. In addition, as I am graduating and none of the other students like doing this, next week's post will likely be the last.
