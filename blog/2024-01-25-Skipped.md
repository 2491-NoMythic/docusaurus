Hello all, apologies for the lack of blog post on Tuesday. I left early for slightly personal reasons and no-one thought to make one in my absence. But I am back today, and ready to recount the events of the night:
* Auto Work (Me, Griffin, Rowan): A lot of auto work was done. I just made two autos and then fought with Github for a while. The other two were making paths until they started working on the sensor instead.
* Sensor Research (Zach, Griffin, Rowan): Initially this was just researching the minimum range of the planned distance sensor. More specifically, what happened when something got within minimum range. Then it turned out that we would need to download the required vendor libraries onto every single computer. We decided not to use that sensor. (For those in the future who might be looking for distance sensor options, it was the Revlib 2M Distance Sensor.) Then we started working on a new sensor and it's stuff until that broke.
* More Limelight Work (Serena, Davey, Rowan): We are finally out of limelight hell for the moment. Averaging math was done so now we can have accurate positioning. Neural net stuff can wait.

Es geht. (I'm learning German.)
