Hello again. The weather is unreasonably warm for winter in Minnesota, regularly hitting the 40s. I just hope there is snow again. Anyway, things that were done today:
Constants List (Me): We now have a list of constants to change. More than half of them are shooter constants. 
Kraken Adjustment(Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): We finally have a practice bot with Krakens. As such, we needed to assign all of the motor and cancoder IDs, calculate the offsets, and check if the current PID values still work.  
Other Adjustment (Griffin): Griffin spent most of practice on PID work for Moira. This included defining what a meter.
Light Work (Davey): The lights are under construction, and are apparently going to be used for signalling this year.
Pathplanner Fixes (Rowan): Pathplanner switched its coordinate system on us and we had to very rapidly fix it. 

In other news, Captain23 was here today.
