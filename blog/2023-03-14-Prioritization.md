We were working today. We even had all of programming!

* Button mapping (Mowi and I): We went through the code and found all of the buttons currwntly in use. This is useful because if two plus things are mapped to the same button, bad things happen.
* Arm work (Yours Trulyâ„¢ and Captain 23): If we want the arm done by the 10000 Lakes Regional, we need to work fast. From what I could tell, they spent practice doing a lot of complicated math. I won't try to translate given that it is very complicated but it looks accurate. 
* Intake work (Rowan): The intake work is going well. Motors have been linked to the rollers. Also it apparently uses the D-Pad, which I haven't seen used before. 
* Endeffector polishing (Me): I modified the endeffector code so it should be able to run backwards now.
* Motor Assignment (CornerGremlin): A bunch of spark motors have IDs now. 

When I say all, I mean minus Act of Liam.
