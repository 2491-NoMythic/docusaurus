Hello. Sorry about the lack of updates for the past several months, but there have been talks about not using Docusaurus anymore. The primary concerns are the requirements of pulling code to VScode and knowledge of Markdown. If this happens, the blog will likely die. I did not want to upload things that would get deleted in a few short months anyway, and no one else uses this without prompting because of the above issues. Anyway, there will likely be one more post covering the training season in broadest forms, and then a cancellation announcment (with a link to the new p-log if that plan pans out). Anyway, things that happened today:
* Updating (all): New season means new software updates, so we spent the first chunk of practice dealing with that. Most of us updated computers, but Griffin handled the limelights and Xiaohan did RoboRios.
* 2025 Skeleton (Nigel, Mowi): These two started working on the skeleton of the new robot.

Maybe something more?
