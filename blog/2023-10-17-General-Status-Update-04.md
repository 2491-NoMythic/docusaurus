See comments from last week about wanting a replacement.

* Minne Trials Update (Xiaohan and I): The Minne Trials code has started. Xiohan made the drivetrain while I excised the example code.
* New Student Training Update (Davy, Griffin, and Zach): The new students are slowly learning Java, and Griffin is within three exercises of the end. 
* Elevator Update (Rowan and Serena): The elevator is now controllable via joystick. 

That's all for tonight!
