Today was the second practice, and the first day of school! This is our last practice before the Experience-The-Team nights, so we prepared our stations. An electronics board with two motors was constructed and tested. Every circuit playground and computer pair was tested. We also created some new code for revolution. Well, it had been created awhile ago, but never tested. We tested it a lot and debugged it a lot. At the end, we had it driving and shooting with the push of a button!
