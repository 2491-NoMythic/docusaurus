Today was spent on last minute auto testing. Some other stuff happened as well.
* Carrying Test Pieces (CornerGremlin, Mowi, Me): We carried a bunch of the game structures from Great River's storage area in the gym up to the test area. Presumabley this happens every day, I just haven't heard about it.
* Driver Station Stuff (Mowi, then most of Programming): The planning on Tuesday has led to the modification of the driver station today. This took most of practice.

Kudos if you get the reference.
