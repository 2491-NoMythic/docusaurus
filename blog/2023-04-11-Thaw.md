We had an open house tonight. We were also working!

* Driver Station Design (Evelyn, Omariahn, Rowan, and others): They made a new design for the driver station because the old one was too clunky. I don't know much about the new design other than that it goes by the name 'Unicorn Horn'.
* Button Map (Me): I updated the button map.
* Compute Updates (Omariahn and Evelyn): We had kept some computers on the 2022 code, but they updated the computers today.
* Merging Things (Royce): Royce merged a bunch of branches into main.

Today is slow for right before Worlds.
