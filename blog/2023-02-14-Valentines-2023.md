The most important thing that happened today was filling out the We See You form. It's a short form the mentors send out to make sure that everyone on the team is being seen and heard, as well as to give team members a chance to reflect. Other things that happened today:

* Code Polishing (Me): This started as SkiPlow testing, but then went in a completely different direction. By ther end of practice, I had synced all the subsystems to one PS4 controller and deleted the now-defunct intake code.
* Cancoders (Evelyn and Omariahn): Evelyn and Omariahn made it so that all of the wheels would line up when the robot was enabled.
* Feature Tags (Ben and Quinn): Yours Trulyâ„¢ will explain this. And that I will! Feature flags are essentially togglable subsystems. The drivetrain, arm, skiplow and more have a little slider to them. I think its pretty cool and each files get saved to the RoBorio and so you set them once and only go back to change them anytime you have to turn on or off a subsystem.
* Lights (Rowan): Rowan continued working on the ID lights from last time. 

Take care!
