Today was the first practice with our new members! Programming's new members are Nigel and Omariahn (who was on the team two years ago). The two new programmers started working through the circuit playground missions. Thomas helped Augie (for the first half of practice), Griffin, and Zach to work on a Universal Joystick Class, so that we can switch out different controllers without changing the code. Davey and I (Rowan) worked on Eurydice, who needed to hvae every sensor double checked, limelights double checked, and swerve drive offsets recallibrated. Looking forward to the rest of the season with all these new folks!
