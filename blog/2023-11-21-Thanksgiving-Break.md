It's the week of Thanksgiving, that lovely time of year where we meet our relatives, eat lots of food, and argue with said relatives about politics and said food. Avalon got the whole week off (ish, today and yesterday were flex/conference days), Great River gets the next three days off, and Robotics ceases for nothing.
* Elevator Update (Rowan and I): A final draft of workable elevator code was created, with PID tuning to keep it upright.
* PID Stuff (Xiaohan): Xiaohan learned PID stuff.
* New Student Upate (Griffin, Zack, Davie): They were working on learning how to make joysticks work with motors.
* Revolution Updates (Rowan):Firmware and software were updated. For the record, Revolution is the name of an old robot we are refitting because we think some of our work on it could be adapted to this year's game, based on the shooter/stacker game alternation. We are not actually fermenting revolution against the State of Minnesota or the United States of America. Please do not arrest us over our robot name.
Happy Thanksgiving.
