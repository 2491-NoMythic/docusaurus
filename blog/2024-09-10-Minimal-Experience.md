There was an experience the team night tonight, but only two people showed up, one of whom had been to the one last Thursday. Anyway, things that happened:
* ETTN (All): We did our standard experience the team night routine for the two people who were here. No-one made the sun and I had to rush through the saftey/circuit presentation, but both people got to drive the robot.
* The Auto Challenge (All): In lieu of other things to do, we started messing around with sequential command groups to get better at making autos without Pathplanner. In the process we learned that the Rotate Robot command did not actually work properly. Oops.

That's all for tonight.
