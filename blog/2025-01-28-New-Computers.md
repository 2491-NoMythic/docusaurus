We got new computers today!

* New computer updates (Xiaohan): Getting these set up.
* Reef lineup code (Rowan, Davey, Mowi): The code is now committed. 
* Radio Updates (Griffin, Nigel): These happened. 
* Button Board Work (Me): Finally figured out how to use the goddamned library. 
* Servo research (Zach): This happened.

There was also a meeting with the Drive Team to decide what they wanted to automate.
