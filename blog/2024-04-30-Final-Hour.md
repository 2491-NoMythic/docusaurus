"Ode to Garrulousisity"
Davey has tattoos.
Davey enjoys rats and fire.
Davey is very very strange.
Davey should get a Loofa. With the new Loofa, Davey can say goodbye to daily stains and dirty surfaces. These tattos are filthy, but just 3 shots from Loofa, BANG BANG BANG! And it sparkles like new! Look how it cleans this greasy hob, BANG BANG BANG! Goodbye dirt! Grubby arms, BANG BANG BANG! There, all clean again! New Loofa, now with laser sight and night vision for after dark cleaning.
