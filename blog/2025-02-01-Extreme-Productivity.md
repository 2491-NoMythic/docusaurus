We got so many things done today. 
* Robot container cleanup (Me): Removed extraneous imports and fixed the preferences. Also fixed the fact that the climber was named CimberSubsystem.
* Servo work (Me): As it turns out, the reason the PWM repeater wasn't working is that it wasn't plugged in. 
* Practice Field Report (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): Drove the robot around.
* Autoalign (Rowan, Zach): This is as tested as it can be without a practice field.
* Elevator Stuff (Griffin, Me): Elevator now has limit switch.
* Controller Fixes (Griffin, Nigel): These happened.
* Barge command (Serena): The barge algae command works now.
* Button Bindings (Serena, Davey): These were set up and a diagram was made. 
* Radio Work (Xiaohan, Rowan): The new radios work now via a pair system. 

And Knuckles.
