Today we shall learn the names of the robots. Our two options will either be Purple Rain and Delirious or Orpheus and Euridyce. I am voting for the former. Despite that, there were only a few things that happened today. On that list was: 
* General Robot Work (Rowan, Zach, Xiaohan, Serena): We got to bring the robot to the practice field, and there was a lot that had to be made ready. Wiring, tuning, rearranging the CAN network because they got merged at some point, making sure the intake limelight had a working neural net, the works. Also messing with limit switches.
* Shooter PID Work (Me, Rowan, Chris [M]): As part of the testing it was decided that we needed a feedforward PID system to make sure the shooter wouldn't be pulled down by gravity. This took like an hour of Chris and I struggling with various encoder types before Rowan came over and solved the problem in about ten minutes. I'm glad that Rowan is the captain instead of me. 
* Bumper Work (Davey and I): The bumper construction team required assistance, and we obliged. I only worked with them in the morning, Davey stayed during the whole practice. 

Just four more practices until Duluth.
