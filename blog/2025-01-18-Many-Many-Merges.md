Many merges happened today, and many other things as well.
* Elevator completion (Me, Rowan): The elevator code now has a distance sensor and is as functional as possible. 
* Funnel Intake Command (Nigel, Serena): This exists now.
* Place Corral Commamd (Davey, Zach): This command (using the elevator and the intake) exists now.
* WPILib Updates (Me, Nigel, Zach): Updates were required. 
* Side to Side Lineup (Griffin, Act Of Liam): This exists now.

Not sure what else happened, was in bathroom.
