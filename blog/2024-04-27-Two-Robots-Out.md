Today we had our 2 robots out until 2! They were both at the practice field which led to the rest of the programming subteam to be unable to do any robot code work. However, at the practice field we had some amazing work done with our autos and general drivers practice.
Back at the shop we had some really cool research done on some other options for software, we looked into things like Choreo for possibly better autos and Elastic for a better dashboard during comp. We also had someone look into how to actually MM (motion magic) tune a motor as currently only one of our mentors knows how to do it.
Over the next few days we plan to continue research into possible better alternatives for software (Glass, A custom dashboard, and/or other alternatives we aren't currently aware of). We also plan to continue some amazing work on our super cool offseason projects.
