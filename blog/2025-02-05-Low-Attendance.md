As most people do not schedule their lives around robotics and today was Wednasday rather than Thursday, we were missing a large number of people. 
* Button Board Work (Me): Got the driver station to recognize the code, then spent the rest of practice Slack messaging Chris and Captain-23. 
* Practice Field Report (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): Testing revealed lots of issues in the paths and got to within two inches of accuracy from odometry. They also ran a three-coral auto just driving in eleven seconds.
* Coral Endeffector Testing (Griffin): This works now.
* Algae Intake Code (Zach): This exists now.
* Climber PID Tuning (Davey, Omariahn): This was attempted, but it didn't have all the parts.
* Minor Tasks (Serena, Nigel): These two added a preference for the motor logger and a limit switch for the elevator. 

We also discovered that the logger can accidentally fill the entire RoboRio storage.
