WE'RE IN THE WALLS! WE'RE IN THE ******* WALLS!

Apologies. Conferences were going on, so everyone had to cluster into the build room. Eventually Ops got their room back, but Programming only got about half an hour before we had to move to the gym. The cramped build room, combined with moving twice, had me a bit on edge. It felt like we weren't supposed to be there. Add that to the fact that we were supposed to be quiet, and it felt like the meme was appropriate. Or maybe it's just my not-actually-paranoia acting up. Who can tell. Anyway, things that happened today:

* Engineering Log (Omariahn and I): We spent some time working on the engineering log. It's still in the outline stage, but Omariahn started adding paragraphs.
* Misc work (Royce): Royce worked on auto pathing, among other things.

Oh god, I just realized the opening ramble is more than half of the post.
