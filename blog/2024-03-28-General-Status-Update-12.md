Nothing special today. Things that did happen:
* Shooter Ramp-Up Adjustments (Rowan, Me, Griffin): The rev-up code was altered to make it faster. This was accomplished by making it spin at full speed until the shooter RPS went over the target RPS, then switching to the PID loop. 
* Manual Climber (Zack, Davey): The climber got a manual mode controlled by the operator controller joysticks. 
* Intake Adjustments (Rowan, Serena): The intake was adjusted to match the robot speed.

We also partially planned the schedule for 10K lakes/Minneapolis/Williams.
