We played in State this past weekend. Overall it went about as good as we were hoping, and we managed to get 3rd place, out of around 35 robots. Coming back from that, we are beginning to get ready for our summer work, the offseason.

* Debrief (Full Team): Finishing out our final competition, we decided on some projects we might want to do over the summer, and noted them down.
* Roses and Buds (Full Team): As we reflected on the season, we decided to think about what went well, and what we wanted to improve, based on our experience, and write these thoughts down to help us decide what to do next year.
* Offseason Goals (Full Team): Taking our list of projects we wanted to finish during the summer, we voted on which ones we would prioritize, and who was interested in which goal. 

All in all, our season was pretty great, and I am excited for next year.
