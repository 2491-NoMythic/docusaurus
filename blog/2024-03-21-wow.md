Today there were confrences at GRS. We got kicked out of our room. Not much happened.
* Math clean up (Serena and Augie): With Evan's help, they worked on making a sepreate subsystem for the shooter math. 
* PhotonVision (Me): I looked up stuff on PhotonVision and found out that it would not be super effective to use it because we would have to get reid of our limelights and make our own. So not cool
* Auto testing (Serena, Zack, and Rowan): I don't really know what to write here, it's pretty self explanitory.
* Reading drivetrain code (Augie): Augie checked for errors and unessary code.

We talked a lot bout mario 64 and whomps. I really like whomps. The sound the make ("RRGH") is wonderful.
