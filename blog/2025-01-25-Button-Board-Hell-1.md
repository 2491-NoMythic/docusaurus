The title is not a reflection of the overall programming status today, just what I had to go through.
* Button Board R&D (Me): We discovered many ways that button boards fail. We can't use VScode, I didn't realize that a seperate digital IO was required, the CP stuff kept getting in the way, and etc, and ect. 
* Motor logging (Nigel, Griffin): These two set up a logging system for our motors. This was we can record real-time and past data on motor behavior. 
* Algae shooting command (Mowi, Serena): The algae shooting command exists now.
* Lights (Mowi): Lights progress was made. 
* Merges and Elevator Stuff (Xiaohan): Everything is now merged to main.
* Distance sensors (Griffin): The coral intake and funnel now have distance sensors. 

I'm saving Button Board Hell 2 for when we have to make the actual button board.
