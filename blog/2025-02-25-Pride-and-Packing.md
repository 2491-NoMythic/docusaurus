My sibling (who is on ops, not programming) dressed up as Elizabeth Bennet for the day because they felt like it, and we packed for the Duluth trip.
* Packing(Xiaohan, Serena, Mowi, Davey, Griffin): We packed a crate of stuff for Duluth. It includes computer bags (each with a computer, charger, ethernet cable, and REV cable), spare radios, several Xbox and PS4 controllers (the Button Board wasn't done in time), an extra computer, and portable chargers. There were going to be spare Limelights but Rowan left them at his house.
* Test Mode Creation (Me, Rowan, Nigel): We set up a test mode for use during pit checks. 
* Robot Tuning (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): The robot was tuned and driver practice occured.

Also, the last half of practice was spent doing not much because there was nothing to do.
