Lots of things happened today.

* Limelight Testing Finished (Ben and I): This is the reason for the title. Most of programming was spent hunting for the bug, which turned out to be the command not requiring the subsystem to run. This was confusing, as we thought that that was fixed. A bit more digging on Ben's part revealed the error, and so we got the thing working. A bit of debugging in the merge request and we were done for today. As I said, Next Time. 
* Further Swerve Calibration (Royce, assisted by myself): This has been going on for several practices now. Today, Royce and I downloaded a firmware update to fix the massive inversion issues from last week. After that, Royce spent the rest of practice PID tuning the drivetrain. 
* Pneumatics (Evelyn, Omariahn, and Ben): These three were working on pneumantics, and realized that there were wiring issues. They also began writing the skiplow code. 

See Y'all in February!
