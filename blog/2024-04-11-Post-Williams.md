Today was primarily a day of reflection, and making plans for state. 
* Github Cleanup (Me): I deleted 75% of the branches that were on Github and were just taking up space. 
* Documentation (Me, Rowan): We started a document with some best practices for programming. 
* Limelight work (Xiaohan, Davey): There is a new and more reliable software for limelight out now called Megatag 2. These two updated our limelights with it. 
* Faster Revdown (Serena, Zach): One of the issues we have been having is unreliable amp shots. These two made the motors drop in speed quicker so that the shooter wouldn't overshoot. 

Nothing more to say, really.
