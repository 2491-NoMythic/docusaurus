Tonight was a very loud night in programming. Things that happened:

* LED Discussion (All of Programming): We spent the first half an hour of programming discussing how we were going to handle the 'sick lights' this year. We ended up figuring out that there were three methods; doing what we did last year, buying a Blinkin (spellcheck needed) from Rev Robotics, or building one our selves. Omariahn asked to code the lights.
* Pneumatics Testing (Omariahn and Evelyn, possibly Rowan): These two/three
* Swerve Stuff (Royce and Quinn): Swerve work is going to be ongoing for another several weeks. I just hope it's done before Duluth.
* Rowan programed the Prototype Endeffecter and switched the motor to NEO 550.
