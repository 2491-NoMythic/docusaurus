10K Lakes was not as good of a comp as Duluth, but we still did good. Highlights:
* We placed 14th in the rankings. 
* We got picked up by the #2 alliance and then proceeded to lose twice in the playoffs. 
* We won the Industrial Design Award. 
* We will not being going to worlds this year.

# Technical Stuff 
* There actually was not a lot for programming to do. We did make the lights flash white when the robot picked up a note. 
* Many autos were made faster. 
# Event Stuff
* We had the same win/loss ratio as in Duluth, but kept only getting the victory RP and not the Melody or Harmony RP.
* Our alliance was with Talon Robotics and Lightning Turtles. We did not have a catchy name this time; the closest Griffin and I could come up with was the Talons of the Turtlecorn.
* We won the Industrial Design award partially due to documentation stuff like this. So future NoMythites, please keep this operational.
* Williams Arena is really fun to explore if you ignore the caution tape and chains on stairwells. There's just more unused space than there is at the Duluth East Convention Center or the building Worlds is in.
