Starting on Saturday, updates will be moving to the regular team blog. Anyway, things that happened today:
* Swerve drive refit (Me, Griffin): I improved the swerve drive code, continuing a project I was working on in the off season.
* Auto testing (Davey, Mowi): Davey and Mowi did PID tuning and made some auto paths using the new software. 
* Third limelight testing (Rowan): We now have a limelight program that works with a third limelight. 
* Alignment work (Griffin): Griffin made a system that lets us align the robot with poles on the Reefscape field.
* Skeleton work (Nigel): Nigel made some very basic subsytem stuff.
* Other alignment work (Xiaohan): Xiaohan made some other code to help us line up with the reef.

See you over there.
