This will be the last post before Duluth. A very few things happened today.
* Light troubleshooting (Augie, Rowan): We troubleshot the lights. They work now.
* Packing (CornerGremlin and others): A lot of packing happened. Due to shennanigans, we weren't allowed to bring the cart.

Also, we hit a new record for Pink Panther Loops: 30.
