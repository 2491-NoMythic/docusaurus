Most of programming was at the practice field today.
* Practice Field Work (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach, Act of Liam): There were a lot of things done. Most of the changes were tuning the algae endeffector and streamlining passing coral within the robot. In particular the intake command was modified to be more reliable and avoid hitting the elevator. 
* Button Board Work (Me, Griffin): As Clay didn't have buttons today and there were some issues involving ten copies of the CAD file, most of what was done was code. I reworked our pathfinding systems to accommodate a switch between going to the closest side and going to a preselected side. 
* Pit Scouting Auto Stuff (Serena, Mowi): These two worked on the scouting form and created kitbot and everybot autonomous programs we can give to teams that don't have them. 

Also, Davey, Griffin, Nigel, and I went to the scouting form training today.
