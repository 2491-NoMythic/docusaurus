We're fixing a bot and the walls are off white. Things that happened today:

* General Subystem Patching (me): I spent the first chunk of practice fixing random things in the code. I started with testing the skiplow. The one error encountered was caused by the solenoids being mapped to 2, 3, and 1 instead of 5, 4, and 3. Afetr that, I fixed the arm code to use CANSparks instead of Talon SRXs.
* Lights (Rowan): Rowan spent practice working on the lights code. Turns out that circuit boards don't play nice with code for an entire robot. But he got it working and purple. And then make them dance.
* Swerve Drive (Royce and Evelyn): These two continued working on the swerve drive. We now have more autos! Royce also worked on hooking up Apriltags to the swerve drive.
* ~~~Ben was at drive practice for most of the day, if he wants to add programming stuff that he did he can do that.~~~ Edit 2/18/2023: Ben was working on feature flags.

You know, I thought that next week was Duluth. Brain fart!
