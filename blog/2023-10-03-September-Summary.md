Summary of things that happened during September and the first October practice:
* ETT nights happened. We did the board demo, robot demo, and code demo, not in that exact order. 
* The team now has new members. Programming got four and a half new people. I say half because Xiohan transfered from Build and Quinn transferred out to Ops. The new people are Serena, Zack, Davie, and Griffin.
* Kickoff for the Minne Trials (personal note: can the Turtle/Minne Trials/TEST please pick a name and stick to it) happened. The game is about corn silos. As usual, please look elsewhere for actual game rules. Xiohan and I attended. 
* Rowan has started elevator code. 
* The new students are learning Python.
