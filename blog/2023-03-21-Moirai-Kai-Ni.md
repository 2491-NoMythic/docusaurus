Today, we have Moriai again. The robot now has a (mechanically) functional intake, arm, and endeffector, and looks truly massive. So what better to do than test it?
* Arm testing (Captain 23): This started out with a lot of SparkMax issues. After those were fixed, the arm moves! Later a bug showed up that made it so that trying to control the motors from the Rev app just broke everything and disconnected it from the rio. Then the cord on the elbow pulley sliced through the plastic wheel it was mounted on. The shoulder works though. There may or may not have been some breakage of the robot (shown below) We all congregated to build funeral style and bid farewell to the robot. We got a kick out of that. We sent it of to build like that and build threw that back at us. All in good fun!

* Rainbow HellLights (Me): I made a variant of the rainbow lights that should work on the robot. Or more accurately, fixed all the errors and actually implemented it in Robot Container.
* Endeffector Testing (Captain 23 and Rowan): The endeffector kind of works. There were a few errors, like getting the cone and cube commands reversed, but they were easily fixed.
* Robot Documentation (Ben): Ben wrote a bunch of stuff about the 2022 robot, Janus.

I don't know what Kai Ni actually means (based on my limited knowledge of Japanese I'm guessing something along the lines of Mark 2), I was just making a Kancolle reference. UPDATE: I looked up what it means. It means 'times to', which is close enough.
