I was too busy to make a post on Saturday, so here is the abridged version: we brought Orpheus to week 0 at Irondale, it failed, we went to the practice field with Euridyce, it also failed. Now, what happened today: 
* Manual Backups (Me): As it turned out that more than half of the automatic functions on the robot didn't work, the decision was made to make manual backup systems. This was complicated by the driver and co-driver arguing over who got what.
* Safe Mode (Griffin): Griffin made a safe mode for pit testing.
* General Testing (Rowan, Serena, Xiaohan, Zach): A lot of testing of shooting happened.

Apologies for posting this so late.
