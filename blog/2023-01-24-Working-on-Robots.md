Today was a blinding day in programming. Mostly to us.

* Further Limelight stuff (Both of Us): Making SmartDashboard see the Limelight. It took a while and several failed attempts, but eventually we got the info from the Limelight to the robot and SmartDashboard. We also made a motor that should react to the light. The Limelight LEDs and circuit board LEDs were very bright, hence the day being blinding.
* More Swerve things (Captain 23 and Quinn): These two soldered wire on and recalibrated the swerve drive. 
* Arm Work (Yours Trulyâ„¢, Mowi, and Rowan): They worked on programing the prototype arm, and were succsessful. They also fixed the elbow of the arm because it wouldn't move, and rewired the robot to properly use the arm.

Take care y'all!
