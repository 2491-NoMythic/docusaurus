We did the team captain nominations earlier than normal (because five of six captains are seniors and the last one is a junior, we wanted to give them more training time). Today Zach, Xiaohan, Opal, and Nyx. Anyway, stuff we did today:
* Algae Autos (Me, Mowi): We made three algae autos and a bunch of paths. 
* WPICal research (Davey): More research is done, and Davey told the drivers what videos to take.
* L1 Scoring (Zach, Griffin): This was made but not tested. 
* Elevator tuning (Rowan, Serena, Nigel): There were some alterations to the elevator, so these three needed to make sure it still works. It did.

Officially, this blog should be impartial as to the captainship of the team. Unofficially, Nyx all the way 'cause they're my sibling.
