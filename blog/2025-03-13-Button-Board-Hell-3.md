We went back to working on the Button Board today. 
* Button Board (Me, Mowi, Xiaohan, Zach): We worked on some of the button board stuff, as the frame is under construction. Mowi and Xiaohan were kind enough to wire the buttons while I finished the code on the circuit board. 
* Elevator Tuning (Rowan, Zach): The elevator was tuned some more. The PID values are now more accurate. Also it Sang The Song Of Its People a lot. 
* L1 placement fixes (Serena, Nigel): The L1 placement code was fixed, probably.
* Co-Driver Controls (Zach): There is now an Xbox controller configuration for the co-driver. 
* Algae Stealing Command (Griffin): This was worked on. 
* Intake Testing (Griffin, Nigel): These two helped Build tune the intake motors.

Also, Zach taught Margo how to do co-driver stuff.
