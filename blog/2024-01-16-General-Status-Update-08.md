Hello again. Various things happened today, mostly because we had the robot to work with.
* Intake work (Me): This was annoying to code. Five motors, multiple potential configurations, design requirements changing MULTIPLE TIMES during production... ugh. This was made marginally easier by not needing a PID loop, but was still pretty difficult. It was also helped when the brush-roller miscommunication stopped. 
* Limelight Work (Xiaohan, Griffin): There was going to be limelight stuff done, but Xiaohan got called away and Griffin didn't have the knowhow. 
* Autoshoot (Serena, Zach): Most of the math is done. In addition, there is a command for rotating the robot with the autoaim. 
* PIXY stuff (Zach): Zach did work with object tracking and a PIXY camera. 

So, yeah.
