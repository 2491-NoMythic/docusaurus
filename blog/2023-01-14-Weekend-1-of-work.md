It's the first Saturday of build season, and I was the only experienced programmer there in the morning.

Okay, that's not entirely fair. The new trio actually has experience now, and they spent their time working on making command-based robots. Evelyn had a lot of errors in the morning, but they were sorted out. Things went smoothly for Omariahn and Rowan. I spent the morning working on the intake and importing the CAN and Talon stuff.

Royce showed up in the afternoon. We worked on testing swerve modules. We had to wire each motor and Cancoder in, test them individiually, and then unwire them and move on to the next. After testing, it turned out that most of the Cancoders didn't work thanks to soldering issues. The new trio tested their code on the TEST robot George. 

Terminate log.
