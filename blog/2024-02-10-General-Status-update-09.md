Can someone who is not me write a blog post for once? Every time I am out sick for whatever reason no post gets made. i might need to just start adding 'write a blog post' to the list of things to do. Anyway, things that happened today:
* Distance Sensor Work (Me, Rowan): I spent most of practice working on a distance sensor. This involved soldering a lot of thingas, fighting with CAN errors before learning that the fleeming thing was unplugged, and then Rowan moved everything from the intake to the indexer. Also we accidentally turned on preferences that weren't supposed to be on and had to do some work to fix them.
* Limelight Work (Xiaohan, Act of Liam): The limelight that broke yesterday is fixed.
* Lights Work (Rowan, Zach): The first chunk of practice was apparently spent dealing with a github error. By the end of the day the lights were finished.
* Move 1 Meter (Serena, Davey, Griffin): The 1-meter auto is in progress. Apparently part of the issue was wheel diameter, which was re-measured and now the robot moves almost one meter. It does still consistently undershoot.

I have convinced Rowan to add 'write the blog post' to the list of things to do each day.
