* Autoangle Test (Serena, Nigel): These two tested code for autoaligning with the reef. It works. 
* Distance sensor Stuff (Mowi, Griffin): Programmed a thing that makes smart dashboard blink green when sensors activate.
* Other sensor stuff (Davey, Xiaohan): These two finalized the list of sensors we need to send to Build. 
* Elevator Stuff (Davey, Me): We finished the early elevator code. We still need to add a distance sensor.
* PID Loops (Rowan): The PID loops are finished.
* Drive pathing (Zack): Zack started a drive pathing project.

I have a headache.
