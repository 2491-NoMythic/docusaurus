This is partially an experiment in formatting, using a bullet point list of things we did.

* Printing Apriltags (Ben and I, assisted by Nyx). We printed Apriltags, which was a minor adventure because the printer wasn't normal. After a failed ethernet attempt and not being able to find Micheal, we just found a chromebook and just followed the instructions on the wall. 
* Limelight Testing (Ben, Quinn, Rowan, and I). After the Apriltags were printed, Ben and I got the board set up. Then Ben altered some settings to get better visibility and we checked that the tags registered. This lasted most of practice because Ben had the laptop with the actual limelight stuff on it, and I didn't know how to set things up.
* Swerve Work (Captain 23 and Quinn). More work was done on swerve stuff todays. I don't really understand what they're doing but it seems like swerve should... well, Captain 23 says that he hopes he finishes soon.
* Pneumatics testing (Ben). Some people from build needed a programmer to run pneumatics they were testing.
* Autonomous (New Trio). The new autos were tested today. The robot was short enough that the usual table barricades wouldn't work, and Mowi had the robot ram into him before it was adjusted. Outside of that things went smoothly enough, and the TEST robot drove, both autonomously and by joystick, with their code.

This has been your recap for this Saturday.
