Tournament posts are always long, so as usual, here are the highlights.

* We took the bus there and back, which led to some delightful team bonding.
* We stayed at an Air B&B, which most of the team agreed was nicer than a hotel.
* The robot did not work for about half the competions due to signal interference.
* We were not selected for the playoffs, but did collect the Carver division Team Spirit Award.

Anyway, read more below!

Addendum: Starting from here, any sections written by me will be using 24-hour time. 6:00 PM is 18:00, for example.

# The Bus Ride

This covers both the bus rides there and back, along with loading and unloading at Great River. Because of how long the drive was, we hired a tour bus driven by two guys who were, for better or worse, both named Larry. The plan was to leave great river by 10:00, which meant loading our luggage started at 9:00, and the team was told that we planned to leave at 9:30.
