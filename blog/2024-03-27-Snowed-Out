We had practice today because yesterday was snowy, and all was canceled.
* Illumination (Augie): Augie worked on our indicator lights.
* Controller Map (Me): I made a new slide for our new Driver and Co-Driver Maps.
*  Climber Arms (Serena): Serena worked on making arm controls the way the drive team wanted.
* Amp Shot(Zach and Xiaohan): These two worked on testing our Amp Shot, and doing Drive Team things.

Here's tonights joke: Why don't rats breath fire?...
A: Because if they did, they would suffocate.
