The last full-team practice before Minneapolis 2023. Things that happened today:

* Limelight Testing (Me): Just getting Tyche's limelight to functional.
* Programming Bin Packing (Evelyn): We once again cannot bring the cart to the tournament, so Evelyn packed a bin. 
* Arm Testing (Rowan, Royce, eventually more people): The first success was in telling the arm to go to a set position using Smart Dashboard. They then started working on hooking that up to a button.
* Cone Mode Switch (Multiple Unknowns): We now have multiple modes for picking up cones on either the endeffector, intake, or both. I'm not sure which.

Yours Trulyâ„¢ can add anything that happened after I left. Otherwise, this is the end.
