Tonight was the Mythical Night with Robots, a fundraising event so we can go to worlds. A lot of friends and family of team members showed up. Half of programming hid in here. 
* Pratice Field Stuff(Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): Calibration was tested and then drivers practice happened. This involved measuring every single reef pole down to one-sixteenth of an inch. 
* Button Board Rework (Me): I adjusted the button board to deal with a control alteration. To make a long story short, we didn't need one of the climber buttons anymore and had to change it from momentary to toggle in the process. There was also miscommunication about what exactly up and down meant so now there aren't climber up and climber down buttons. 
* Profiling Work (Serena, Nigel): The profiler was successfully set up for a robot that does nothing. It scans down to the milisecond. We also learned that the code can't run on a Roborio 1.

Also Mowi worked on the robot reveal more.
