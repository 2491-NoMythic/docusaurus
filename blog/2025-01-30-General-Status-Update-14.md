Important things happened, but not necessarily exciting things. I think that nine programmers is slightly too many. 
* Button creation (Me, Xiaohan): The two of us added a control to allow the co-driver to choose whether to line up with the right or left pole for placing coral.
* Algae processor command (Nigel, Griffin): This is done.
* Servo testing (Griffin, Nigel): This happened, but it went not well. 
* Algae barge command (Serena, Mowi): This sequential command group exists now. 
* Drivereef Testing (Rowan, Zach): A lot of work on pathing and gyro repair happened. 

That's all for today.
