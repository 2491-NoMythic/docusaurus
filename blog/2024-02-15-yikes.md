Today was a bit of a disaster. One of the intake motors started smoking (this is bad for you, don't smoke). The programming room smelled like burning tape, which is a lot worse than burning hair.
* Canceled task (Zack and I): We were going to set up the gym for testing Moirai but build stole her permanently.
* Shooter angle (Augie, Rowan, and Serena): worked on testing the shooter angle math.
* Wireing and such (Xiaohan):They worked in build with wiring and other stuff Rowan said he's good at. Also he (maybe) fixed the practice bot! This is great news.
* Hall effect (Griffin): He worked on testing the hall effect sensor (I am not really sure what this is).
* Limelights (me): My new job was to make the limelights on the practice bot have the correct values for something. I'm not exactly sure what.
I also wrote all over the white boards in Orbonian glyphs. This was not exactly important but it made me feel better.


Side note: having itchy eyes sucks.
Side Side note: It snowed last night. That was weird because it has not snowed most of the winter.
