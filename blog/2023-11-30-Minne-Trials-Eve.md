* Limelight Work (Augie, Xiohan, Liam): We tried to get a limelight to functional. We had to flash it and then get the casing off to fix the fan. This took far longer than it should have 
* Auto Code (Xiaohan, Rowan): These two have been building auto code for Minne trials. Modifiying last years swerve code to fit this year's needs.
* Odometry Work (Liam, Serena): They seem to be doing a lot of math and complicated stuff to get odometry working. Odometry is how the robot positions itself on the field, and is essential for autonomous. They have already called two people about math stuff.
