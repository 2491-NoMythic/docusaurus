We were able to work on the robot today!
* Robot PID Tuning(Rowan, Xiaohan, Davey): The elevator was mostly PID tuned, but some people are going to stay late to finish.
* Button Board Work (Me, Zach): the CAD for the button board is done and ready to X-carve. In additon, several bugs in the code were worked out, and final assembly of the board-end code can begin soon. 

Also Serena and Mowi worked on the robot reveal video.
