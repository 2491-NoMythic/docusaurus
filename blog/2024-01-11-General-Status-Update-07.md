Today's lesson in programming: read the docs first, don't be overconfident, and CANcoders/Cannivores run on 12-volt power. Anyways, things we did today:
* PID Controlling (Us + Davey): We began adding PID functionality to our shooter, to keep two motors running at the same speed.
* Moira Work 2 (Xiaohan, ): Moira was still broken from last time, so they worked on fixing it. It turned out that the CAN network was plugged into the wrong thing, and a few other things needed to be fixed.
* Projectile Math (Zack, Serena and Rowan): They worked on some of the math needed to get the Auto-Aim working, and ended up learning about Ballistic Physics. They also attempted to figure out the formulas needed for the Aim.

Never forget, always remember: Read the docs, or be at practice till September.
