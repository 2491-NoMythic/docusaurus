Headache too bad for funny.
* Minne Trials Update (Xiaohan, Liam, and I): The Robot is working now. We got the escalator working, and spent a while trying to get the wheels to cooperate. I spent half of the time standing around looking pretty because I didn't know what to do and other people were on the computer that was hooked up to the robot. This is not a good thing. 
* New Students Update (New Students): They are working on sequential command groups. This will become important when they start doing autonomous programs.
