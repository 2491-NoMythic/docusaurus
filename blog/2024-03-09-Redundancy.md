Not a lot was done today. 
* Practice feild (Xiohan, Zack, Rowan, Serena): I assume they are testing autos and other new code. As I am not there I do not know for sure what is going on.
* Programming room (Augie and I): We worked on ground pick up that turned out to be not nessacary and deleted and redid our work a lot of times. Then we deleted unused branches.
*Morning work (Serena and Zack): This morning it was Serena in charge because rowan was at a bar mitzvah. So Serena and Zack worked on auto aligning for the shooted and other auto stuff.

I had a headache and the team celebrated Liam and Levi's birthdays.
