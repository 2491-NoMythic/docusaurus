Apologies for the lack of post on Thursday, both people I requested make a post in my absence forgot. Anyway, things that happened today (in programming):
* Limelight Work (Me, Xiaohan, Davey, Rowan): We needed to make sure all of the Limelights were competiton ready. This meant making sure every limelight had the apriltag and detector software, even if not every Limelight could do both jobs. We ended up with one apriltag tracker, one detector, and two that could do both. We also figured out the offsets for the limelight currently on the robot. 
* Auto Work (Serena, Rowan, Griffin): A lot of autonomous work of varying kinds was done today. We now have an auto that shoots one note and then gets out of the way, a list of available paths, and the existing autos modified to have the feeder be off at the start and the initial pre-loaded shot to happen.
