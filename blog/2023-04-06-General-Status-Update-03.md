Today we worked on a lot of different things that had to get done at some point.

* Auto Stuff (Captain 23 and I): The robot has a bunch more autos now. I actually made some and learned how they work. Personal note: I have wanted to learn how autos work since the start of the school year.
* Disabled Mode Lights (Yours Truly™): Yours Truly™ worked on setting up some code so that the robot will do things while it is powered but not active. This is mostly so we can run lights.
* Code Cleanup (CornerGremlin): CornerGremlin deleted a bunch of code we don't use anymore. 

We are getting closer to Houston. Speaking of, WE WON IMPACT! WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
