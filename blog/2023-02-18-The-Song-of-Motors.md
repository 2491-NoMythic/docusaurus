Today was a day of sound and light. Mostly because CornerGremlin's new job is to play music. Anyway, things that happened:

* Lights for human player (Augie and Evelyn): We worked on setting up a light strip to match the color of either a cone or a cube so the human player knows what to put on the field.
* More Skiplow Testing (Omariahn and Ben): This allows us to move a cone or cube, as well as stabilize the charging station. Today's edits were to the control assignments.
* FeatureÂ Flags (Ben, code merged by Royce): Ben was working on feature flags all week, check the Valentine's Day post for details. 
* Musical Motors (Omariahn, Ben, Augie, and Evelyn): We all worked on getting the motors to play music, because they can do that. The easy part was picking songs and converting them to CHRP. The hard part was getting the syntax to work with a Phoenix Pro. It still isn't done. 

Now Programming has music to equal Build! Ops kind of just does very dramatic karaoke.
