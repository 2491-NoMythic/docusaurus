A lot of interesting things happened today.
* Funnel work (Serena, Davey, Nigel): The funnel motors spin now on a sine curve.
* Button Board Prototyping (Me, Mowi): There is now code to make the buttons light up, and a prototype of the physical board.
* Control Scheme Decisions (Xiaohan, Zach): The control scheme has been finalized. 
* Lights command work (Rowan, Griffin): This is almost done. 

As I said, interesting times.
