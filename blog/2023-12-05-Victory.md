This post is called vitory because we got 2nd place in Minne trials! 

* Robot work (David, Zack, Griffin, and Serena (kinda)): New progammers worked on making code for our Minne trials robot, Ryan. Griffin and Serena were succseful in this endeavor. I didn't feel like talking to mentors so I read up on what we were doing and tried to comprehend.
* Swerve drive (Rowan, Xiohan, Augie): The goal today to debug and/or finish revolution code. The computer with the revolution code was left at someone's house so they worked on getting swerve into a single repository.
