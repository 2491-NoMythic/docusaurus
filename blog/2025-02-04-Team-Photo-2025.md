We took the team photo for the year today. In other news:
* Elastic (Serena, Mowi): Because Shuffleboard broke, we had to find a new SmartDashboard equivalent. These two decided on and tested the program Elastic. 
* Practice bot limelights (Xiaohan): The practice robot and its limelights are functional.
* Odometry intake test (Rowan, Davey): The robot should intake automatically when it is in the intake zones. 
* Lights (Zach, Me, Davey): We plagarized heavily from last year's code to do everything we can on the lights without actually having a concrete arrangement for the LED strips. 
* Controller fixes (Griffin, Nigel): These were finished and merged. 

Also, the first round of robot name polls is almost complete.
