Today, we got Moriai back to test. There was some CAN wiring to do because build didn't remember to wire everything together.We were able to test the precision-drive, arm, and intake. Precision-drive worked the first time, which is interesting. The arm motors were not working. 
Other things that happened today:
* Endeffector Code Weirdness (Mostly Me and Rowan): There was a kerfuffle in the code because of weird errors that I ran into and Rowan ran into and maybe fixed? I think that if we try to run both it and the arm at the same time something is going to break.
* Rainbow Lights (Me): I made a version of rainbow lights that works on the robot. I got most of the way through.
* PID Values (Captain 23): Captain 23 put PID values for the arm on Smart Dashboard.
* We spent like half an hour talking about MLP and Kingdom Hearts while listening to random songs from the former. The songs continued playing for the rest of the morning This has nothing to do with programming I just thought it needed a mention. 

The title comes from our robot names: Moriai (our Duluth/Practice bot, name meaning Fate) and Tyche (our Minneapolis bot, named after the Greek goddess of luck).
