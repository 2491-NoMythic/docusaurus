It's been a while since the last post. Here is a list of the important things that have happened.
* Liam came back from his trip. And there was much rejoicing. 
* Captain nominations happened. The new roster is: Liam for the whole team, Jospeh for Ops, Rasmus for Design, Clover for Production, and Rowan for Programming. 
* Summer projects were proposed. I'm going to be learning the art of swerve!

Outside of that, it has mostly been cleanup and meetings. Into the off season we go.
