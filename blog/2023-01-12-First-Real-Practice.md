Today was the first practice of the build season! We have our game, we have a plan, and we can start coding.

Techincally Tuesday was the first practice, but it was basically "'kickoff part 2'" and the only important thing that happened was creating the repository of the 2023 robot. If you are looking for a descriptipn of the game, or of kickoff planning, please look elsewhere. While this is technically a blog, I consider it more of a record for internal information. It's on the site that's basically just for programming and no-one else has a reason to look at. I'm pretty sure Ops has a wonderful description of the game somewhere, and kickoff can be summarized thusly: "'We should do something!'" *breaks into small groups* "'What have our small groups decided we should do?' 'EVERYTHING!'" *several rounds of voting* "'Alright, back to small groups'". Repeat for ten hours until we finally figure out what to do.

Anyway, programming today. Captain 23 and Quinn worked on swerve drive. Ben tought everyone else how the normal code works and had them make normal drivetrains. I helped out with that, but spent most of my time waiting for a job that turned out to not matter. That's life I guess. Also, Mowi expressed in interest in taking on the task of lights when the time comes.

I also learned that GITHub is a pain in the a** thanks to some backend stuff causing the branch to fork. That's why a lot of blog posts are late. Then again, this is more of a log than a blog anyway.
