We have returned from competition, and spent the first chunk of practice debriefing. Our current goals are, in order of priority:
1. Fix the power managment so that we stop browning out in the middle of matches. 
2. Improve odometry.
3. Make scoring in the amp more reliable. 
4. Make more autos, including at least one three-note auto.
5. Make the lights work (partially contingent on Build attaching them).
6. Improve the data log system to collect even more data.
7. Make the robot able to shoot accurately while moving.
8. Make the robot able to shoot accurately at extreme ranges.
9. Shoot into the trap.

Anyway, things that acutally happened today:
* Code Review (Rowan, Me, Davey, Serena, Zach): Rowan went over the entire robot code to make sure that everyone was up to speed.
* Duluth Code Merging (Rowan): The Duluth code (with some alterations) was commited to main.

The title is a pun.
