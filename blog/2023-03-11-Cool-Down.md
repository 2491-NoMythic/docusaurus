So Duluth happened. Today was our first in-person practice since (Thursday was mostly talking about strategy and a good chunk of the team was online). Most of the team didn't show up. Evelyn was in the ops room all morning, Ben and Royce were at the practice field, and most of the mentors were out, so it was just me in the programming room. I just worked on the end-effector. It should function properly now. 

I'm glad it was a slow day.
