No posts last Thursday or Saturday because of competition. I'll get the megapost out at some point. No post this Tuesday because there was no practice, and no post this Thursday because I was sick and no-one else does this. :(
* WPICal (Davey): This program is designed to find Apriltag placement problems. Apparently it is also difficult to set up/
* Button Board Work (Me, Omariahn): We selected buttons, finalized the layout, and handed it off to Build.
* Practice Field Stuff (Rowan, Xiaohan, Zach): Tested new targeting PID instead of Pathplanner (it works now). They also tested automatic processor and barge algae placement. Apparently the placement loops got funky.
* Auto Barge Algae Named Command (Me): This exists now.
