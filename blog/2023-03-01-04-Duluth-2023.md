This is going to be a long post. After the packing events on Tuesday (which have their own blog post, it just got lost somewhere), we went on the trip. As this is a very long story, I have used the truncate function to conceal it from the general list. If you just want the highlights: 
* We won the Team Spirit award.
* We made it to the second round of the playoffs, lost, and then lost our first match in the lower division. 
* My roommate got Covid and it wasn't discovered until after the trip.

Day 0 (load-in):

Our story begins on Wednsday afternoon. We loaded up the bus at 4:30 PM and started driving.
