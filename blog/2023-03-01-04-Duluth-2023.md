This is going to be a long post. After the packing events on Tuesday (which have their own blog post, it just got lost somewhere), we went on the trip. As this is a very long story, I have used the truncate function to conceal it from the general list. If you just want the highlights: 
* We won the Team Spirit award.
* We made it to the second round of the playoffs, lost, and then lost our first match in the lower division. 
* My roommate got Covid and it wasn't discovered until after the trip.

Day 0 (load-in):

Our story begins on Wednsday afternoon. We loaded up the bus at 4:30 PM and started driving. 30 minutes later, they gave us sandwiches for lunch they ether had roast beef, turkey or ham. There was also a cookie and chip packets that had 60% air in them. After that experience, the drive team members had to take a test for rules and basic do's and don'ts. Everyone else just unloaded baggage from the bus. Once everything was unloaded, we got our room numbers and headed straight into our rooms and unpack. Then we all headed down to the meeting room for closing meeting. After that, we went to the condo and ate dinner, then headed back to our rooms.
