It is negative 19 degrees right now. I am very glad to be inside working on robot stuff.
* Anti-Tip (Serena, Zach): This year there is a very real risk that the robot will tip over if we drive too fast, so these two made code to hopefully autocorrect. 
* Algae Intake Command (Me, Serena): This exists now, and uses robotState.
* Spark Refit (Rowan, Davey, Nigel): Many systems had to be switched from Talon motors to Spark motors.
* Design Doc Update (Xiaohan): This has been updated with new sensor and motor details. 

Also CornerGremlin showed up to chat for a bit. That was nice.
