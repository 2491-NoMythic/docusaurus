Hello there ladies and gentlemen and others! We are back in the official training season. I was the only student here until about 7:30. Things that happened today:

* Board Demo Code (Me): We are planning on running a motor during Experience the Team night, and decided to fish out the old board code so we could run a Sparkmax. After several hours of trying to update multi-year-old-code, I gave up and wrote new board code.
* Item Sorting (Rowan, Emilio "[M]"): For the record, anyone with the "[M]" tag is a mentor, and generally won't be credited unless they did the majority of the work. The electronics still needed inventorying, and these two did it.
* Python Exampling (Chris "[M]"): Chris had to make the python code for EtT nights because I was busy and Rowan was gone.

Anyone who has been around the site for a while will notice that some names are gone. This is deliberate. Anyone who has left the team will have their name replaced by their title. The only way to find their actual name is to go into the code, look for the file 'TRUENAME', and read it.
