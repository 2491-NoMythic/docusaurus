We are doing things again in Programming, which means that this can have the normal format again! But first a bit of housekeeping: Yes, the team retreat happened this weekend. Yes, it is very important to the team. No, I will not be covering the events here, because very little of it was relevant specifically and directly to Programming.
* Java Courses (Zack, Davie, Griffin, AKA the New New Trio): The new students are working on Java. If you're wondering why Serena isn't, we'll get to that.
* Design Doc (Rowan and I): A design document is a document that has all of the design details (stuff like hardware, software, and the construction process), used to help Build and Programming coordinate without the need for large meetings. This one is for an elevator some of us older students are working on while the new students do Minne Trials. 
* Swerve Work (Serena): As Serena was the programming captain on their old FRC team before transfering to NoMythic, she is learning Java by making a swerve drive rather than doing coding tutorials like the new students. 
* Minne Trials Planning (Xiaohan):

When I say I need an heir, I mean I need someone else who can do these. I need to do actually coding things.
