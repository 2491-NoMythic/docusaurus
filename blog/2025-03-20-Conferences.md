There were conferences at GRS today, so programming and build had to share the workshop.
* Button Board Work (Me, Xiaohan, Davey, Zach): We have begun construction of a second board. Everyone else did sodering, I just was there at the meeting. Davey also made labels for the first board.
* Practice Field Log Review (Rowan, Nigel): This happened.
* Testmode work (Rowan, Xiaohan, Nigel): This was worked on.
* Auto Improvements (Serena, Zach): The auto paths were made more efficient. 
* Code Cleanup (Me): I started going through the code, adding comments and removing unsused imports.  
* Robot Reveal Work (Omariahn): This was done. It is going well. 

Operations was over at the house of one of their captains.
