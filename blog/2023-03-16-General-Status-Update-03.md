Huh, already March and only the third General Status Update. Weird.

* Cancoder updates (Omariahn and I): We updated and re-organized 15 Cancoders. This is a good thing.
* Arm Update (Royce, Quinn): The math is done and the encoders are set up. All that is left is PID tuning. 
* Button Consistency (Ben): Ben did something I started a few months ago. He made sure that none of the button controls overlapped, no controllers were digitally created more than once, and etc.

Board.
