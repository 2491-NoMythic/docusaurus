Happy Bloody New Year! This is acutally the second practice of 2023, but the first one was virtual and mostly involved teaching the new studnents how to use Git stuff. Today was quiet. Only four programmers showed up; myself and the three newbies. They aren't really new 'newbies' any more, but they are still new and it's a convinient way to remember them. We spent most of practice updating the computers to the 2023 WPI and FRC Tools. None of this was particularly hard, but it was time-consuming. It took hours for everything to download, extended by the computers going to sleep and cancelling them.

 Rowan also worked on upgrading the firmware on the RoboRios. Mowi and CornerGremlin learned how to use all of the Git applications. Good for them, I barely know how any of them that aren't GitHub work. 

I'll never be free, and don't expect any more of this thing at the bottom. The lyrics were to Derivakat's and Yuki's song Manhunt.
I finally realized it was unprofessional.
