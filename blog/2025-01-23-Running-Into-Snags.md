Today was a day marked by things not working. 
* Attempted Endeffector Work (Me, Nigel): We were going to test the endeffector code. Instead we had to deal with CAN wiring and PID tuning. 
* Anti-Tip Coding (Serena, Davey): It is probably done, just needs testing. 
* Reef Lineup (Rowan, Mowi, Griffin, Xiaohan): Spent time figuring out how to fix static. 

CAN wiring was a pain.
