The plan was for the team to be in three places at once today. Ops at the practice field, the drive teams at a mini-tournament called Shamrock Showdown, and the rest of the team at the shop. Then someone enabled the robot while the controllers were still in their holders, it drove itself off a table, and now we have zero functional robots. On a lighter note, here's what programming did today:
* Auto Work (Me, Rowan, Griffin): We made a bunch more paths and autos. The newest ones are three/four notes with automatic pickup.
* Radio Testing (Serena, Jason [M]): There were some communication issues during the Shamrock Showdown, and a lot of time was spent trying to diagnose and fix the issues. It turned out to just be firewall problems. 
* Side Intake Stuff (Serena, Xiaohan): We might be getting side wheels to improve the intake, so these two made code for that.
* Code Cleanup (Me, Griffin): Our code has gotten messy over the past while, so we needed to fix it. Griffin did camelcase stuff, I removed obsolete items from Pathplanner. 

Productive, but not as planned.
