# Limelights and Vision

## Limelight Basics
Limelights are the primary system we use to see with the robot. They need to be set up before use. If you want to know how to do that, then follow this [link](https://docs.limelightvision.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) to the official Limelight website, which explains far better than I can. If the Limelight has been used by the team before, check before flashing new firmware. An important note is that you need to use a power over ethernet cable for power. Teams have experienced issues plugging the ethernet cable into the second port on the radio, so it is recommended to use an ethernet network switch to run both the RoboRio and the Limelight on the same sytem.
