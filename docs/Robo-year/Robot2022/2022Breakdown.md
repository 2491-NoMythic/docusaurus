# Hello! I'm Janus

My favourite color is purple and I played in the 2022 game RAPID REACT!

I am named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and endings. The god is typically depicted with having 2 faces, one facing the future and one facing the past. This name was chosen to represent the idea that our team has come back after the pandemic and is turning a new page in our book!

I can do many things! (I can't acutally do too much, but I do what I do well) I am comprised of 5 subsystems: Drivetrain, Climber, Intake, Vision, and Lights! These files with have most of the important infomation for me and my drive code as well as any personal anecdotes that came with programming me!
