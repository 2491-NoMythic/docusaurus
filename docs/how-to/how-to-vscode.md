# How to VS Code

## What we use it for + Installing

VS Code has become a defacto stndard editor in many circles due to it being free, but as powerful and extensible as it's expensive professional cousins. We use it for lot of things at NoMythic. It is currently the standard recommended editor for createing java based robot code. For developing java robot code, I recommend following the [instructions at First](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) and getting the software bundle that includes it. Be sure to check the box that installs VS Code.

The NoMythicApp is also being developed in Typescript/Javascript using VS Code. It is recommended but not required to use it for development. You can use the VS Code that came with the FRC install, or if you do not need those tools, download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Docusaurous pages are written mostly in markdown. This means any text editor will do, but useing the above link to install VS Code will allow you to see an immediate accurate preview of the markdown (.md) file that you are edting. 

## Get Started

![get started](./img/vs-code-get-started.png)

When you first open VSCode you will see something like the picture above. It is designed to work with a project, so we are going to open a folder for a project. For this example we will use our docusaurus project. If you don't have it dowloaded yet you can still follow along, maybe pick another folder on the computer.

>If you don't have docusaurus you might want to check out [How to Git](./how-to-git.md) to use Git from the command line, or follow the [How to Git with VSCode](./how-to-git-with-vscode.md) to learn how to use Git inside VSCode.

So click Open Folder. Navigate to the docusaurus folder and press the Open button.
